# Understanding the new United States

Opponents of President Trump often say his actions make no sense. It's possible his actions would make sense if we understood his motivations. 

A couple of former KGB agents have reported that Donald Trump was recruited by the Kremlin in 1987, and given the codename Krasnov. I'm mildly curious to know if it's true, but don't know if we'll ever be able to confirm or deny those reports. 

The next best thing to proof might be a thought experiment, to explore whether the President's actions are consistent with those a Russian asset might take. If so, then it doesn't matter if he was officially recruited by the Russians; the outcome is effectively the same.

To do that, let's speculate about what Russia's goals might be, and also how they might go about establishing a relationship with someone who may or may not prove useful to them at a future time. 

## Russian goals (speculative) 

An obvious and immediate concern for Russia is its conquest of Ukraine. Things aren't going as smoothly as the Russians expected. Early in the war, when the Russians were excited about the prospect of a quick victory, former Russian president Medvedyev expressed their desire for a Russian-controlled zone from Lisbon to Vladivostok. There was much jubilation in the Russian media. 

That goal involves the conquest of all of Europe, not "merely" the reinstatement of the borders of previous Russian empires. 

Russia also has territorial ambitions in the East. If you draw a line from Lisbon to Vladivostok, it passes through a big chunk of northeastern China. Well, *that's* inconvenient, isn't it, Moscow? And then there are those Japanese islands the Russians so wanted to occupy at the end of WW II. 

North Korea has been a Russian client state since 1950. China has maintained a relationship with Pyongyang to balance Russian power in the region and as a way to poke at the US, but with the recent changes in international alignments they may have to consider building relations with successful economic powers like South Korea and Japan, if they want to proceed with their stated plans for economic growth. North Korea can't help them with those plans and, as a tool of the Russians, could even pose a risk to China.

Russia needs a boost in the Pacific region to counter the large and modern Chinese navy. If the US became a client state, the combined Russian and US navies could overwhelm the Chinese, Japanese, and South Korean navies. The Australian navy would survive for about fifteen minutes.

The US with its traditional alignments is the blocker for these ambitions. If Russia could drive a wedge between the US and Europe, and between the US and its Pacific allies, there would be nothing to stop Russian imperialism. 

And to make sure those alliances can never be restored, it's also necessary to degrade the US itself, in any and every way possible. Gaining a measure of control over the US government would enable that.

## A Russian asset (hypothetical)

Let's say I'm a construction magnate in the US in 1987, and my business is doing poorly. I'm broke and I can't qualify for a business loan on the merits. I need an infusion of cash and at least one sizeable project to get things rolling. Otherwise, I'm done.

I receive an invitation to visit Moscow. I'm not the only American businessman to receive such an invitation. During my visit, the Russian authorities offer me a lucrative construction project to build a hotel in Moscow. Almost immediately I receive offers for several business loans from various banks on generous terms; terms my company isn't really qualified for. Just lucky, I guess. From that point forward, business is good for me. 

The Russians don't ask for anything in return. They're only cultivating relationships. They don't know which American businessman, if any, will ever be in a position to serve them. But it's understood that I'll be expected to act in their interest, should the time ever come that I might be of use to them. After all, everything in life is a transaction; a "deal." 

They took care of me in my time of need; now they're holding a marker. If they call it in, I must honor it. But they probably won't. The world would have to be very different for that to happen. So it's a pretty safe deal for me!

Life goes on and things change. I attain celebrity status in the US, partially through television shows and the gossip mill that surrounds celebrities, talking about the amazing parties I throw and my trophy wife. I get away with all sorts of things that would land a regular person in prison, or at least cause people to shun them.

No matter what I do, people love me. For instance, one of my ardent supporters made a T-shirt for herself with an arrow pointing downward and the phrase, "Trump can grab my pussy." The idea took off and became a product line [](https://www.teeshirtpalace.com/products/trump-can-grab-my-pussy-arrow-2020-election-women's-v-neck-t-shirt_tcgm384-wvt?color=black&size=L). It's still selling pretty well! That goes to show what American women really want.

In the mid-2010s the things I say publicly resonate with certain segments of the US populace. I run for President on a lark and to my surprise, I win. But I'm not prepared; I don't know what to do as President, and I lose the next election. 

But I don't lose general popularity. Some people even go so far as to try and overthrow the government by force on my behalf. I feel encouraged. 

I gain the backing of three key support groups - the Heritage Foundation, the Dark Enlightenment people, and the Seven Mountains people. My personal base of support - violent, racist extremists like the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, and the Ku Klux Klan - grows more vocal and active. 

The Russians observe all this with interest. They even help my election campaign indirectly, using their impressive skills with misinformation and hacking. 

I win the Presidency again. Only this time, I'm prepared. I know exactly what to do to repay my supporters - the violent extremists, the Heritage Foundation, the Dark Enlightenment leaders, and the Seven Mountains Christian extremists. 

And I receive a phone call from Moscow. They want me to do them a little favor. It's fine with me, because it will increase my personal power and fame. The deal we made in 1987 is still working for me!

## Thought experiment

Given an idea of what the Russians want and a hypothetical way they could set up an asset at a high level in the US, what would this Russian asset do as President of the United States? 

They would want to move quickly, at a pace at which government doesn't usually move, and overwhelm the system of checks and balances with chaos. They would want to do as much damage as possible before institutions, companies, and individuals realized what was happening and could rally any sort of effective resistance. Pushing the boundaries of the constitution and the law, they would discover who was willing and able to push back, and who would fold under the slightest pressure, or willingly exchange their honor for a few dollars.

What to do? Maybe the following, for starters:

Deport scientists who fled Russia in opposition to the invasion of Ukraine back to Russia

Undermine and weaken US intelligence-gathering capability by exposing agents' identities, declassifying and releasing documents, consistently calling into question the actions of intelligence agencies, and appointing people to head the CIA and FBI who are opposed to those organizations for their own personal reasons

Vote in alignment with Russia in the United Nations, alongside North Korea, Iran, Belarus, and other fellow Russian client states

Dismantle the US civil service using people who were not elected to any office and who employ illegal and unconstitutional methods, throwing people out of work unceremoniously and for spurious reasons, without legally-mandated advance notice, and without access to the forms and procedures necessary to apply for continuation of healthcare benefits

Further undermine the US civil service by cutting off funds for numerous agencies without going through Congress, as required by law, and issuing orders for some agencies to cease performing their work

Increase the difficulty of voting by changing voter registration rules, bullying and threatening the lives (through proxies - those good old grassroots supporters!) of election volunteers, closing polling places in areas where "undesirables" live, ending mail-in voting, and other measures as opportunities present themselves

Destroy longstanding international alliances that balance Russia's power, such as the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and South Korea 

Destroy longstanding economic relationships such as those with Canada, Mexico, China, and the European Union

Alienate formerly friendly countries by detaining tourists on spurious grounds without due process of law

Cripple the US legal system by bullying attorneys and targeting specific law firms in Executive Orders; first one, to test the waters, and if they capitulate then turn up the heat 

Nullify the judiciary branch by defying or ignoring court orders and asserting the President is not obligated to follow court orders, and by harassing judges who are seen as opponents of the President

Nullify the legislative branch by bullying elected representatives into following orders instead of seeing to their constituents' best interests, by demanding personal loyalty oaths, threatening the careers of party members who don't toe the line, and by governing through Executive Orders that bypass the constitutional legislative process

Destroy the US' position as the world's leading "soft power" by stopping foreign aid, bullying foreign governments, and other actions that cause people to lose trust in the US

Destroy the US' position as the world's leader in scientific research by halting funds and forbidding scientists to work on certain projects, to communicate with the public, or to meet with each other; where possible, call into the question the legitimacy of their fields of research, to discourage any sort of meaningful recovery of US status in those fields

Destroy the US' reputation as a human rights supporter by engaging in heavy-handed action against immigrants and refugees, including actions that rise to the level of crimes against humanity 

Destroy the US' reputation as a defender of freedom and national sovereignty by threatening territorial grabs, sending military aircraft and vehicles to "visit" territories tagged for acquisition, haranguing heads of state of traditional allies, and threatening foreign governments with tariffs and economic sanctions if they fail to capitulate

Destroy the US' reputation as a defender of human rights by proposing to depopulate a region that is not part of the US, relocate its entire population at gunpoint, and convert the area into a resort for the ultra-wealthy

Silence all voices of opposition from professional journalists to student activists; no target is too large (New York Times) or too small (eleven-year-old who posted an anti-Trump video)

Undermine the US' reputation as a civilized country by using law enforcement agencies to carry out street hits instead of arresting suspects (e.g., antifa protester suspected of killing Trump supporters, ambushed and shot down in the street instead of arrested)

Weaken the US economy by setting tariffs that drive inflation and suppress growth

Appoint individuals to head government agencies whose personal goals are to eliminate those agencies 

Appoint individuals to key government positions who are not competent to serve in those positions 

Purge the military and other public institutions of anyone who might oppose the President

Pardon insurrectionists and propose using taxpayers' money to reward them financially

Seek to eliminate the Social Security program, leaving American seniors destitute, homeless, and unable to access necessary medical care, as much to terrorize the next generation as to harm the seniors directly

Cancel funding of Social Security benefits for disabled children, accompanied by public declarations that "empathy" is a cause of civilizational collapse

Facilitate the rapid deterioration of US natural resources by ending regulations and standards pertaining to environmental stewardship 

Encourage the worst elements of society to come to the fore by promoting racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and the public mockery of handicapped people

Strengthen racism by offering special asylum status to white South Africans

Strengthen racism by scrubbing government websites and publications of information about non-white contributors to the country's success 

Strengthen racism by threatening schoolteachers with permanent blacklisting or imprisonment for making students aware of unapproved historical information

Strengthen racism by pressuring local school boards to remove posters and slogans from schools that celebrate diversity, such as a poster showing multiracial children's raised hands and the slogan, "everyone is welcome" 

Strengthen racism by cultivating positive relationships with white nationalist extremist groups and parroting their rhetoric

Strengthen racism by describing "diversity" programs as racism against whites, and pressuring companies to change their hiring practices to favor white applicants

Strengthen racism by throwing Black ambassadors out of the country

Weaken the US' ability to feed itself by alienating and terrorizing those who perform field labor to bring in the crops 

Weaken the US' ability to recover from a food crisis by destroying the strategic seed bank

Weaken the US' ability to address a health crisis by cutting funding and staff at key medical research institutions

Degrade the general health of the population by appointing a person who is opposed to healthcare and doesn't understand medicine as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services 

Weaken the US' ability to deal with severe weather phenomena by shutting down NOAA and scrubbing decades of climate-related data, and forbidding agencies to publish such data

Weaken national security by using unsecured communication methods for sensitive discussions and by declassifying documents on a massive scale

Dishonor the military by requiring Arlington National Cemetery and the Department of Defense to remove all mention of non-white patriots, heroes, and high-ranking officers from their official websites and publications

Erase the national cultural history of the US by forcing the Smithsonian Institution to adhere to specified ideological requirements

Terrorize people by deporting "undesirables" without due process of law, not to their home countries but to a special foreign prison facility notorious for torturing and "disappearing" people, with no contact with legal cousel, their families, or their embassies; pay the prison operators by the head so they are incentivized to hold prisoners indefinitely

Pay private detention centers in the US by the head as a way to encourage them never to release anyone once they have them in custody

Terrorize the general population by deploying armed, masked "officers" whose uniforms bear no insignia or other indication of their law enforcement function to collect people from their homes in the middle of the night or from the street in broad daylight, without warrants, without charges, and without due process of law

Simultaneously (a) terrorize "undesirables" and (b) undermine the moral fabric of American society by forcibly separating children from their parents without due process of law and with no possibility of their reuniting in future

Set the stage for costly and damaging healthcare crises in future by discouraging vaccinations, discontinuing health additives such as flourine in drinking water supplies, eliminating oversight and regulation of the food industry, and discouraging healthy eating and exercise habits; combined with the shutdown of medical research and healthcare facilities, this should result in a resurgence of horrific illnesses such as measles, tuberculosis, and polio, as well as frequent outbreaks of food poisoning, all aimed at maintaining the US population in a weakened state

Compensate for the loss of workers by scrapping child labor laws

Cripple the US' ability to recover from all this damage by destroying the K-12 public education system as well as intimidating, de-funding, and controlling the curricula of public and private universities; gain popular support for this by dividing Americans against each other on the basis of formal education

Of course, this is only hypothetical. I'm sure if something like this really happened, the Russian asset in the White House would think of many more suitable actions.
